# 🌟 Elevate — Gamified AI Onboarding & Career Growth
> Finalist project at the SAP × NTU AI Agents Hackathon

## Problem
New hires are often overwhelmed by long PDFs, scattered training resources, and generic onboarding that doesn’t match their roles. Engagement is low, progress isn’t tracked, and HR teams get overloaded with repetitive questions — slowing productivity and increasing attrition risk.

## Solution
**Elevate** is a multi-agent, gamified platform that transforms onboarding and early career development into an interactive journey:

- 🎮 **Gamified Learning Modules** — bite-sized videos, tasks, and flashcards with XP, levels, and badges.  
- 🤖 **AI Career Coach** — chat-first support for FAQs, policies, and role-specific guidance, available 24/7.  
- 📝 **Checklists & Flashcards** — reinforce knowledge and track task completion with instant feedback.  
- 🎯 **Role Personalization** — onboarding adapts to employee role, department, and career goals.  
- 🏆 **Leaderboards & Achievements** — social motivation through streaks, badges, and friendly competition.

## Who it’s for
- Startups and teams onboarding engineers and product talent.  
- HR & L&D teams looking to reduce repeated onboarding questions and improve ramp-up speed.  
- Bootcamps & training cohorts that want measurable, engaging learning experiences.

## Impact
- 🚀 **Faster, stress-free onboarding** → employees ramp up in weeks, not months.  
- 🧭 **Role-aware learning journeys** → tailored to real projects and career progression.  
- 📊 **Clear momentum** → tracked milestones, transparent progress, and confidence boosts.
